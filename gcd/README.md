You can do it naively by enumerating factors of both A and B and looking for largest common factor. This will take `O(sqrt(A+B))` time.

#### Solution Approach
We can use euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm is as follows:<br>

gcd(A, B) = gcd(B, A mod B) <br>

#### The complete pseudo code is as follows:<br>
Note: where A is greater than B. If not, then swap.
```
function gcd(A, B)
	while B â‰  0
	   T := B
	   B := A mod B
	   A := T
	return A
```
The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(log(min(A,B)))` and space complexity is `O(1)`.
